Use case diagram drawn
Sprint consisted of planning phase using trello
Sprint planning: user stories

Development was carried out using C#
An OMDB API Key was sourced
Github was used to maintain code changes

Initially, an interface method with OMDB API was considered

Pretty effective

Trello has been an effective tool for coallating ideas, 
especially with a limited team size. Really helps
improve efficiency

Github is a very efficient system for sharing progress in real time. Also useful for 'code review'-- reading and making sure others' changes fit the coding standards for the rest of the project.

Expectations:
Would involve a lot of API interfacing.
Advantages to sprint:
An effective planning mechanism. Nice to refer to stories
Helps keep ideas organised.
Disadvantages:
Planning not as useful with limited team size

Requirements changed (Feature update) occured after initial sprint, 
Next sprint will focus on tackling these new features.
